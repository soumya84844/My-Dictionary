# My Dictionary Project

In this project, I created a dictionary application to help users manage and organize their vocabulary. The main goal of the project was to provide a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and searching for words and their definitions.

## Features

1. Word Management: Users can add new words to the dictionary, along with their definitions and any additional notes or examples.
2. Search Functionality: The application allows users to search for specific words within the dictionary, making it easy to find and retrieve information.
3. Edit and Delete: Users have the ability to edit or delete existing words and their definitions, providing flexibility and customization options.
4. Categories and Tags: The dictionary supports categorization and tagging of words, allowing users to organize their vocabulary based on different themes or topics.
5. User-Friendly Interface: The application is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the dictionary.
